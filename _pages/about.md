üë®‚Äçüî¨I am a hardware digital design engineer at Texas Instruments. 

üéìI have done my B.E. in Electrical and Electronics with a minor in Robotics at BITS Pilani,India. 

üìùMy professional intrests include low-power SoC design, digital design, hardware functional safety, 
  and automation. I am also exploring use of AI-ML in chip design methedologies to help achieve faster
  and quality tapeouts. 

üéªBeyond my technical pursuits, I‚Äôm a devoted violinist with 14 years of experience and a certificate
   degree in Carnatic(Indian classical) music, having performed in 15 regional and national concerts. 
   In my downtime, you can find me binge-watching Netflix or streaming my favorite tunes on Spotify. 


üèª Industrial research experience
======
I am a member of the R&D team for low power connectivity group. My team and I design and develop low-power/low-cost SoCs for automotive and industrial clients. 

I have worked on various tasks involving IP development and SoC integration of 2.4GHz BLE SoC for low-power automotive usecases, 2.4GHz BLE SoC for industrial and helth devices, sub-1GHz tranciever SoC. I am Currently working on development of serial peripheral IPs(SPI, UART, I2C) and general purpose timers for a new class of 28nm node devices. 

My expertiese lies in power intent(CPF/UPF) development, power analysis and power optimization. I also have experience in SoC design QC including lint, CDC and low power verification. 

 
üî¨ Undergraduate research experience
======
I worked as an undergrad researcher at [Embedded systems lab](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/embedded-system-design-lab/) of [BITS Pilani](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/) under the guidence of [Prof. Soumya J.](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/soumya-j/) from August 2022 to June 2023. I have worked on the project titled "Application Mapping on Regular Network on Chip Using Deep-RL Techniques". My work resulted in the following:
  1. Investigated fault-tolerant multi-application mapping approaches on network-on-chips(NoC).
  2. Developd and proposed a Deep-reinforcement learning based multi-application mapping algorithm for regular NoC topologies.
  3. Conducted static simulations in a Python environment and dynamic simulations using a System-C based NoC simulator and Orion power tool.
  4. Evaluated how different design parameters, such as core failures(single and multiple), the number of cores in applications, and the size and type of NoC topology affect the performance of the design.
  5. Qualified the proposed approach by evaluating communication cost, latency, throughput, and power consumption.
  6. Proposed approach resulted in reduction of communication costs by 266%. It also shows an improved network latency by 9%, throughput by 1%, and power consumption by 7%.
