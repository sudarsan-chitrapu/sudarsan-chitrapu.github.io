I am a hardware digital design engineer at Texas Instruments. I am part of the R&D team of low power connectivity group at my firm. My team and I design and develop low-power/low-cost SoCs for automotive and industrial clients. My expertiese lies in power intent(CPF/UPF) development, power analysis and power optimization. I also have experience in SoC design QC including lint, CDC, low power verification. I have worked on various tasks involving IP development and SoC integration of 2.4GHz BLE SoC for low-power automotive usecases, 2.4GHz BLE SoC for industrial and helth devices, sub-1GHz tranciever SoC. I am Currently working on development of serial peripheral IPs(SPI, UART, I2C) and general purpose timers for a new class of 28nm node devices. 

I have done my B.E. in Electrical and Electronics with minor in Robotics at BITS Pilani,India. My professional intrests include low-power SoC design, digital design, hardware functional safety, and automation. I am also exploring use of AI-ML in chip design methedologies to help achieve faster and quality tapeout of chips. 
 
Undergraduate research experience
======
I worked as an undergrad researcher at [Embedded systems lab]() of [BITS Pilani]() under the guidence of [Prof. Soumya J](). During the period between August 2022 to June 2023, I have worked on the project titled "Application Mapping on Regular Network on Chip Using Deep-RL Techniques". In my works, I have achieved the following outcomes:
  1. Investigated fault-tolerant multi-application mapping approaches.
  2. Developd a Deep-reinforcement learning based multi-application mapping algorithm for regular NoC topologies.
  3. Conducted static simulations in a Python environment and dynamic simulations using a System-C based NoC simulator and Orion power tool.
  4. Found how different design parameters, such as core failures(single and multiple), the number of cores in applications, and the size and type of NoC topology affect the performance of design.
  5. Qualified the proposed approach by evaluating communication cost, latency, throughput, and power consumption.
  6. Proposed approach resulted in reduced communication costs by 266%. It also shows an improved network latency by 9%, throughput by 1%, and power consumption by 7%.
