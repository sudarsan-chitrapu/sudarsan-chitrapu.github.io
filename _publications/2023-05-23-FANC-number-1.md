excerpt: 'This research article proposes a novel fault-tolerant multi-application mapping algorithm called ”FANC.” The approach is based on Deep-Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can provide solutions for unseen graphs and topologies without prior training. The approach is evaluated using a variety of simulation parameters, such as communication cost, network latency, throughput, and power usage. The results show that FANC reduces communication costs by 266%. It also improves network latency by 9%, throughput by 1%, and power consumption by 7%.'

This research article discusses the challenges faced by the Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture due to increased integration density and proposes a novel fault-tolerant multi-application mapping approach called ”FANC.” The approach is based on Deep-Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN), can provide solutions for unseen graphs and topologies without prior training. The proposed technique uses an ML-based model to extract relevant information from the search data and incorporate it into the search process. This results in a more robust model with a higher convergence rate and solution quality. The approach is evaluated using a variety of simulation parameters, such as communication cost, network latency, throughput, and power usage. Static simulations are performed in a Python programming environment, while dynamic simulations are performed with a SystemC-based cycle-accurate NoC simulator and the Orion2.0 Power tool. The results show that FANC reduces communication costs by 266%. It also improves network latency by 9%, throughput by 1%, and power consumption by 7%. The approach also simplifies and minimizes the search area in the design exploration process and can be used as an auxiliary component for other optimization algorithms.
