In this project,

1. Investigated fault-tolerant multi-application mapping approaches on network-on-chips(NoC).
2. Developd and proposed a Deep-reinforcement learning based multi-application mapping algorithm for regular NoC topologies.
3. Conducted static simulations in a Python environment and dynamic simulations using a System-C based NoC simulator and Orion power tool.
4. Evaluated how different design parameters, such as core failures(single and multiple), the number of cores in applications, and the size and type of NoC topology affect the performance of the design.
5. Qualified the proposed approach by evaluating communication cost, latency, throughput, and power consumption.
6. Proposed approach resulted in reduction of communication costs by 266%. It also shows an improved network latency by 9%, throughput by 1%, and power consumption by 7%.
