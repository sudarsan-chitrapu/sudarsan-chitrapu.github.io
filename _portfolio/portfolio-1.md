Sentiment analysis is an important area of research in academia and is also being employed
by the industry for commercial advantage. There is an explosion of data on opinions of
masses on products, services, public policies, movies, and so on. In this project, we classify
movie reviews into either positive, negative and neutral classes based on their polarity. In this project,
we find the performance of the below DL architectures on movie review classification task.
  1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  2. Fine tuned  Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) LLM
The IMDB reviews dataset is used to perform the experiments.
